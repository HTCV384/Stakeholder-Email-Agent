## Technology Overview

### How IntelliSep Works

IntelliSep is a cellular host response diagnostic that measures the biophysical properties of immune cells—specifically, their deformability—as they respond to infection. The technology uses:

1. **Microfluidic Channels:** Blood samples flow through precisely engineered channels that apply controlled mechanical stress to cells
2. **High-Speed Imaging:** Advanced imaging captures how quickly and easily immune cells deform under stress
3. **Machine Learning Analysis:** Proprietary algorithms analyze cellular behavior patterns to generate the IntelliSep Index (ISI)

**Key Differentiator:** Unlike pathogen-detection tests (blood cultures, PCR) or biomarker tests (lactate, procalcitonin), IntelliSep directly measures the host immune response—the underlying biology of sepsis itself.

### Test Interpretation

The IntelliSep Index (ISI) is a single score between 0.1 and 10.0 that represents the probability of sepsis. The score is stratified into three discrete interpretation bands:

- **Band 1 (Low Probability):** Sepsis Unlikely - supports de-escalation decisions
- **Band 2 (Intermediate Probability):** Sepsis Possible - warrants continued monitoring and clinical judgment
- **Band 3 (High Probability):** Sepsis Probable or Definite - supports aggressive intervention and bundled sepsis care

### Regulatory Status

- **FDA 510(k) Clearance:** January 2023
- **CLIA Classification:** Moderate complexity
- **Sample Type:** EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood (100 μL)
- **Turnaround Time:** <10 minutes from blood sample to result in the lab; ~78 minutes total from order to result in real-world ED workflow

## Implementation Considerations

### Workflow Integration

**Successful Model (Thomas et al., OLOLRMC):**
1. **Two-tiered screening system:**
   - Primary (Triage) OPA: Nurse-driven, based on vitals and questionnaire
   - Secondary (Provider) OPA: Physician-driven, based on Epic Sepsis Model
2. **Protocolized IntelliSep ordering:** Automatic order generation when OPA triggers
3. **Three discrete clinical pathways:**
   - Band 1: Conservative approach, consider de-escalation
   - Band 2: Continued monitoring, clinical judgment
   - Band 3: Aggressive bundled sepsis care
4. **Education & training:** Initial "lunch-and-learn" sessions and journal clubs; minimal ongoing education needed

**Key Success Factors:**
- Nursing staff collaboration and engagement
- Laboratory commitment to rapid TAT
- Physician leadership support
- Administration backing for protocol changes

### Training & Education

**Initial Training (First Month):**
- Journal clubs reviewing published IntelliSep validation studies
- "Lunch-and-learn" sessions on interpretation bands and clinical pathways
- Nursing education on triage OPA purpose and utility

**Ongoing Support:**
- Minimal formal education required after initial training period
- Real-time feedback through OPA system
- Regular quality metrics review and sharing

### Expected Timeline

- **Month 1:** Education, training, workflow optimization
- **Months 2-6:** Adoption ramp-up, protocol refinement
- **Months 6-12:** Sustained utilization, outcome measurement
- **Year 1+:** Continuous quality improvement, expanded use cases

## Competitive Landscape

### Traditional Approaches

**Blood Cultures:**
- **TAT:** 24-72 hours for preliminary results, up to 5 days for final
- **Limitations:** Slow, often negative (only 12-13% positive rate in Thomas study), contamination issues
- **IntelliSep Advantage:** Results in under 8 minutes; measures host response, not pathogen presence

**Lactate:**
- **TAT:** Variable in real-world ED workflow
- **Limitations:** Non-specific, elevated in many non-sepsis conditions, poor positive predictive value
- **IntelliSep Advantage:** Rapid results (under 8 minutes), superior specificity (87.0%); direct measure of immune dysregulation

**Procalcitonin:**
- **TAT:** Variable, typically 1-2 hours
- **Limitations:** Expensive, limited availability, moderate sensitivity/specificity, influenced by non-infectious conditions
- **IntelliSep Advantage:** Faster results (under 8 minutes), superior NPV (97.5%), measures cellular response vs. protein biomarker

### Novel Diagnostics

**Other Host Response Tests:**
- Most are in development or early validation stages
- IntelliSep has FDA clearance and published real-world implementation data
- Unique biophysical measurement approach (vs. molecular/protein biomarkers)

**Key Differentiator:** IntelliSep is the only FDA-cleared cellular host response test with published real-world evidence demonstrating mortality reduction and resource optimization.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does IntelliSep differ from lactate or procalcitonin?**
A: IntelliSep directly measures immune cell biophysical properties (cellular deformability), providing a real-time assessment of the host immune response. Lactate and procalcitonin are protein biomarkers that can be elevated in many non-sepsis conditions. IntelliSep offers superior negative predictive value (97.5%) and specificity (87.0%) compared to these traditional markers.

**Q: What is the turnaround time in real-world practice?**
A: IntelliSep delivers results in under 8 minutes, enabling rapid clinical decision-making in the emergency department.

**Q: Does IntelliSep replace blood cultures?**
A: No. IntelliSep is a complementary tool for risk stratification, not a replacement for pathogen identification. However, real-world data shows appropriate resource allocation—fewer blood cultures in low-risk (Band 1) patients, more in high-risk (Band 3) patients—leading to a 10% overall reduction in blood culture utilization without adverse outcomes.

**Q: What training is required for implementation?**
A: The OLOLRMC experience showed successful adoption with initial "lunch-and-learn" sessions and journal clubs in the first month, followed by minimal formal ongoing education. The three-band interpretation system is intuitive and aligns with existing sepsis care protocols.

**Q: Is there evidence of clinical benefit beyond risk stratification?**
A: Yes. The Thomas et al. real-world implementation study demonstrated a 40% relative reduction in sepsis-associated mortality (10.9% → 6.6%, p < 0.001), statistically significant reduction in hospital length of stay, and optimized resource utilization—all within the first year of implementation.

**Q: How does IntelliSep support antibiotic stewardship?**
A: IntelliSep enables appropriate resource allocation. In the Thomas study, Band 1 patients received antibiotics 40-50% of the time (vs. 94-99% in Band 3), and blood culture utilization in Band 1 patients dropped from 48.1% to 23.8-37.0% range. This represents better stewardship without compromising patient safety.

**Q: What is the cost of IntelliSep testing?**
A: Pricing varies by institution and volume. However, the value proposition includes direct cost savings from reduced blood cultures (944 saved per year at OLOLRMC), reduced HLOS, and improved patient outcomes. Contact Cytovale for institution-specific pricing.
