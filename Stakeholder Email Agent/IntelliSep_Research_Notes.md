### Key Product Facts

**What is IntelliSep?**
- FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic test for sepsis
- First and only FDA-cleared test specifically for sepsis detection
- Rapid blood test that delivers results in ~8 minutes
- Risk-stratifies patients based on probability of having sepsis with organ dysfunction

**How It Works - Technology**
- Uses deformability cytometry and microfluidics
- Analyzes biophysical changes in white blood cells (leukocytes)
- Host response approach (pathogen-agnostic)
- Interrogates tens of thousands of cells to observe biomechanical property changes
- Ultra-high resolution imaging captures cell images
- Machine learning examines biologically relevant features
- Translates findings into sepsis probability score

**Clinical Performance**
- Study: 1,002 adult patients with signs/suspicion of infection in ED
- Spanning 5 adult cohorts from separate observational studies
- Performance compared to retrospective physician adjudication
- **97.5% Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** (from search results)
- Sepsis probability score extends out to 3 days

**Results Format**
- Numerical value between 0.1 and 10.0
- Stratified into 3 discrete bands:
  - Band 1: Low probability of sepsis
  - Band 2: Medium probability
  - Band 3: High probability (patients with sepsis typically fall here)

**Workflow Integration**
- Fits ED and lab workflows
- Uses 100μL from standard 'purple-top' K2 EDTA blood collection tube
- Results automatically delivered to LIS (Laboratory Information System)
- Application begins in triage

**Key Benefits**
- Accelerates time to diagnosis and treatment
- Improves patient disposition decisions
- Enhances ED throughput
- Provides diagnostic confidence
- Pathogen-agnostic (detects sepsis from any pathogen)

### Critical Statistics from Page

**Sepsis Burden:**
- 80% of sepsis deaths could be prevented with rapid sepsis test
- Sepsis is common, costly, and difficult to diagnose
- Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment lead to serious consequences

**Clinical Impact (from search results):**
- 56% relative increase in ED discharges among low-risk patients
- Reduced mortality (specific % to be researched)
- Lowers inpatient bed utilization

### Unique Differentiators

1. **First FDA-cleared sepsis detection test** - regulatory milestone
2. **Host response diagnostic** - unlike pathogen ID or biomarkers
3. **Detects biophysical cell changes** - earlier than traditional methods
4. **Pathogen-agnostic** - works for any infection source
5. **Rapid turnaround** - ~8 minutes vs hours for cultures
6. **Predictive** - probability extends 3 days from test

### Questions to Research Further
- Exact FDA clearance date and regulatory pathway
- Detailed clinical study results and publications
- Comparison to traditional sepsis criteria (SIRS, qSOFA, Sepsis-3)
- Cost and reimbursement information
- Implementation case studies
- Competitive landscape


## FDA Regulatory Status

**FDA 510(k) Clearance**: January 18, 2023 (K220991)
- **First FDA-cleared diagnostic tool for sepsis detection**
- First in a new class of emergency department-focused diagnostic tools
- Cleared to aid in early detection of sepsis in adult patients with signs and symptoms of infection
- Approximately 30 million adult patients annually in US EDs with infection signs

**Additional Clearance**: March 2025 (K250513) - Updated clearance

**BARDA Support**: Supported by Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority contract number 75A50119C00072

## Clinical Study Results (O'Neal et al., 2024)

**Study Design:**
- Prospective cohort study
- 5 emergency departments (Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, Washington)
- 599 patients enrolled, 572 included in final analysis
- Adult patients with SIRS criteria or suspicion of infection

**Performance Metrics:**
- Median turnaround time: **7.2 minutes**
- Sepsis prevalence in study: 26.6% (152/572 patients)

**Band Distribution:**
- Band 1 (low risk): 44.1% of patients (252/572)
- Band 2 (medium risk): 28.0% of patients (160/572)
- Band 3 (high risk): 28.0% of patients (160/572)

**Sepsis Prevalence by Band:**
- Band 1: 11.1% (95% CI: 7.5-15.7%)
- Band 2: 28.1% (95% CI: 21.3-35.8%)
- Band 3: 49.4% (95% CI: [truncated in source])

**Key Finding**: **97.5% Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**

## Recent Clinical Impact Data (2024-2025)

**ED Discharge Study (July 2024):**
- **56% relative increase in ED discharges** among low-risk patients
- Improved patient safety without increasing 30-day return visits
- Lowered inpatient bed utilization
- Enabled safe discharge decisions for patients at low risk of sepsis

**Mortality Reduction (December 2024):**
- Hospital study showed reduction in sepsis mortality
- Specific percentage to be determined from full article

**Growth and Adoption (January 2025):**
- Accelerated demand for IntelliSep in 2025
- Expanding hospital implementations
- Leverages machine learning and advanced microfluidics

## Technology Details

**Deformability Cytometry:**
- Advanced, label-free approach
- Analyzes how individual cells deform under mechanical stress
- Measures biophysical changes in white blood cells
- Detects immune dysregulation (core driver of sepsis)

**Test Process:**
1. 100μL blood sample from purple-top K2 EDTA tube
2. Microfluidic interrogation of tens of thousands of cells
3. Ultra-high resolution imaging during cell deformation
4. Machine learning analysis of biologically relevant features
5. Results in 8 minutes (median 7.2 minutes in clinical study)

**IntelliSep Index (ISI):**
