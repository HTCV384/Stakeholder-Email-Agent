**Citation:** O'Neal HR Jr, Sheybani R, Kraus CK, et al. Cellular host response sepsis test for risk stratification of patients in the emergency department: A pooled analysis. *Academic Emergency Medicine*. 2024;00:1-11. DOI: 10.1111/acem.14923

## Study Design
- **Pooled analysis** of 5 prospective adult cohorts from 7 geographically diverse U.S. sites
- **n = 1002** patients with high confidence adjudicated labels
- **192 patients (19.2%)** had sepsis per Sepsis-3 definition
- Structured blinded adjudication to classify sepsis presence/absence

## Key Performance Metrics

### Overall Performance (Band 1 cutoff)
- **Sensitivity: 93.2%** (95% CI 88.7%-96.3%)
- **Specificity: 87.0%** (95% CI 81.4%-91.4%)
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV): 97.5%** (95% CI 94.0%-99.1%)
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV): 55.9%** (95% CI 48.4%-62.9%)

### Risk Stratification
- **Band 1 (low probability):** n=521 patients
  - Sepsis rate: 2.5%
  - 30-day mortality: 2.9%
  
- **Band 2 (intermediate):** n=243 patients
  - Sepsis rate: 18.9%
  - 30-day mortality: 5.8%
  
- **Band 3 (high probability):** n=238 patients
  - Sepsis rate: 55.9%
  - 30-day mortality: 12.6%

### Clinical Impact
- **Sensitivity > 92%** for identifying high-risk patients
- **0% sepsis-associated mortality** in low-risk (Band 1) patients
- **Stratified severity of illness:**
  - 30-day in-hospital mortality: p < 0.001
  - Hospital length of stay: p < 0.01
  - Use of hospital resources: p < 0.001

### Turnaround Time
- **Test completed within 5 hours** of venipuncture per study protocol
- **Less than 10 minutes** for test completion from 100 μL whole blood specimen

## Clinical Significance
- Provides **clinically actionable results** for patients at both high and low risk for sepsis
- Offers a **rapid, objective means** for risk stratification
- May help **improve outcomes and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use** if integrated into standard of care
- **Superior performance in identifying low-risk patients** (sensitivity > 92%; 0% sepsis-associated mortality)
